# Apollonian Gasket - p5.js

## Demo

Hosted using Github Pages: [https://srirajbehera.github.io/Apollonian-Gasket-p5js/](https://srirajbehera.github.io/Apollonian-Gasket-p5js/)

This project uses random() method to create new internal circles therefore on every refresh to the page, new Apollonian Gaskets will be created.

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js

## Inspiration

March 15 is celebrated as PI day in the world and to celebrate, I created an Apollonian Gasket using the Descartes Circle Theorem and complex numbers.

In mathematics, an Apollonian gasket or Apollonian net is a fractal generated by starting with a triple of circles, each tangent to the other two, and successively filling in more circles, each tangent to another three. It is named after Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga.

Frederick Soddy, an English radiochemist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for his significant contributions to our understanding of the chemistry of radioactive substances and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes. He penned a poem titled "The Kiss Precise" as a reflection of his fascination with the Problem of Apollonius, and his various efforts in contributing to its solution.
